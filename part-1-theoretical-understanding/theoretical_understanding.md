# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

## Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.

**Definition:**  
Algorithmic bias occurs when an AI system reflects the prejudices or skewed patterns present in its training data or design, leading to unfair outcomes for certain groups.

**Examples:**
1. **Facial Recognition Bias:** AI systems trained predominantly on white faces show lower accuracy for people of color, leading to misidentification.
2. **Gender Bias in Hiring Tools:** Amazon’s AI recruitment tool downgraded resumes containing words like "women’s" or all-female colleges.

## Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?

**Transparency** refers to how clear the AI system's processes, decisions, and data usage are to users and stakeholders. It involves openness about how the system works and what data it uses.

**Explainability** refers to the ability to explain the reasoning behind a model’s decision in a way that is understandable to humans.

**Importance:**
- **Transparency** builds trust and ensures accountability.
- **Explainability** helps users understand and challenge decisions, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare or criminal justice.

Together, they ensure **trust, fairness, and compliance** with ethical and regulatory standards.

## Q3: How does GDPR impact AI development in the EU?

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** significantly impacts AI development in the EU by:

- Requiring **explicit user consent** for data collection.
- Enforcing the **right to explanation**, especially for automated decisions affecting individuals.
- Mandating **data minimization**, limiting the amount of personal data used.
- Ensuring **data subject rights**, including access, rectification, and erasure.
- Promoting **privacy by design and default**, pushing developers to embed privacy into AI systems from the start.

This makes AI systems more **ethical, accountable, and transparent**, aligning with the EU’s ethical AI vision.
